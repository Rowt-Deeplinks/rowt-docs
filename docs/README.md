> Simple and Flexible Share Analytics and Deep Linking for JavaScript

### What is Rowt? ðŸ¦‰

Rowt is a simple prebuilt infrastructure for Deep Linking in mobile apps + Analytics about sharing behavior. You can easily [spin up your own server](/get-started#use-your-own), or if you want to get started even faster, you can [use our servers](https://console.rowt.app).

It allows you link to content within your mobile app (and any web link) with analytics on each interaction. Track attribution for visits, downloads, subscriptions, purchases, and more with custom metadata. Our infrastructure is simple, flexible, and easy to integrate.

The only third party requirement for hosting your own server is a Postgres database. The server handles all table creation and management after the first run.

#### Features
